## Goal of the course

Help all of you to establish solid intuitions about short term macroeconomics.

# Resources

![](assets/mankiw_book.jpg){height=30%}
![](assets/challe_book.jpg){height=30%}

Use Mankiw's book to clarify concepts, Challe's if curious about more theory

We will also use a bit[^littlebit] bit of formalism. You can work on it by doing the exercises, but bear in mind that formalism is actually there to help you establish intuitions.

[^littlebit]: a wee little bitty bit if we're honnest...

# Plan for the Course

- Session 1: introduction / reminders on macro
- Session 2: aggregate demand
- Session 3: aggregate supply
- Session 4: macroeconomic fluctuations
- Session 5: monetary policy

# The Classical Economists



- Classical economists were contemporaneous of the development of __industrial capitalism__

- Their goal: understand how market forces could solve society's problems

- Educated belief:
  - Market is the best way to allocate resources that is to take production decisions and allocate goods
  - Government should generally not interfere with market activities

# The Classical Economists

\framesubtitle{One big question}

What determines *intrinsic* value of goods?

- (marginal) cost?
- rarity?
- utility?

# The Classical Economists

Conclusion: there is no intrinsic value for individual goods

- The market determines *value*, by definition

![](demand_supply.png)

Model of Market:
- Supply: cost, rarity
- Demand: utility

*Subjects complain price of bread is too high. People are starving. Bakers complain about rising costs of wheat. Wheat producers are on strike.*

\ 

What should the government do? Suppose you are Adam Smith answering that question.

. . . 

- price cap on bread? subsidize bread or wheat? tax and redistribute? break the strike? nothing?

. . . 

Classical economists promote "laisser-faire":

- government intervention distorts market allocations and just makes things worse

. . .

But if one market is distorted, it should be fixed:

-  terminate the strike.

# The Classical Economists on the Aggregate Economy

For classical economists, it made no difference, whether one was dealing with a particular market or the whole economy.

The response was the same: see which market is temporary out of equilibrium, and if necessary, try to fix it.

---

# The law of Markets : Say's law

Do you remember Say's law?

. . . 

*Supply creates its own demand*

. . . 

Actually. JB Say never wrote this. Full quote: 

*It is worthwhile to remark that a product is no sooner created than it, from that instant, affords a market for other products to the full extent of its own value.*

. . . 


Meaning:

. . . 

*There cannot be a shortage of demand*.

Then what creates aggregate fluctuations and cycles?

- classical economists think it's temporary misfunctions in one or several markets

# Classical or Keynesian? Which view is correct?


In the preceding slides, implicitly:

- demand is defined as "spending"
- supply is defined as "revenue"

But __in equilibrium__, *by definition*

- Revenue = Income (cf circular graph)

Then at the macro level __in equilibrium__  "demand=supply" would be tautological.

We're not equipped to conclude.

# The program of the neoclassical synthesis

Describe a rigorous, quantitative framework, to expose keynesian ideas in a way that is understandable to classical thinkers

Two important questions:

- what is "demand"
- which market is / is not in equilibrium

[Resulting consensus]{.underline} (Long story short)

- *long term* is classical
  - static equilibrium
- *short term* is keynesian
  - dynamic fluctuations

---

# What is demand?

- Depart from the "demand=Income" view.

- __Planned expenditures__:
  - How much economic agents (consumers, firms, ...) would like to spend for a given Income

- of which:
  - __autonomous spending__: what agents spend independently of their income
  - __induced spending__: what they spend when they become richer

- OK, but if spending depends on income, and income still depends on spending, how do we do?

 Suppose *planned expenditures* in the economy are given by:

$$P(Y) = c_0 + c_1 Y + g$$

The equilibrium on the markets for goods and services implies

$$Y = P(Y) = c_0 + c_1 Y + g$$

Assume now, the government spends $g+\Delta G$ instead of $g$

Planned expenditures become
$$P(Y) = c_0 + c_1 Y + g + \Delta G$$

The equilibrium condition becomes \begin{eqnarray*}
& & Y + \Delta Y  =  P(Y+\Delta Y) \\
             & = & c_0 + c_1 ( Y + \Delta Y) + g + \Delta G
\end{eqnarray*}

From which we deduce: $$\Delta Y = \frac{1}{1-c_1} \Delta G$$

::::

:::

It shows that government can stimulate demand with __fiscal stimulus__. Stimulus is higher than its own spending: here $\frac{1}{1-c_1}$ is the fiscal multiplier.

# About market equlibrium

The idea that *whatever people want will be produced* is preposterous!

. . . 

If all markets were in equilibrium, production should already be optimal

- you can't increase it by "wanting" more of it
- excessive demand should be washed off with price increases

. . . 

On the other hand, imagine demand is increased and prices are prevented from increasing. Can the firms produce more?

- no if they are already at maximum capacity
  - then the goods market must be out of equilibrium [^french_economists]
- yes, if they have access to unemployed ressouces

[^french_economists]: Some economists (Patinkin, Benassy, Malinvaud...) went on from there to develop of general theory of disequilibrium. This agenda didn't really succeed at that time.

# The labour market


Then, at constant prices, stimulating demand could work:

::: {.center}

![](assets/unemployment.png){width=80%}

:::

Actually, it depends on the reasons for unemployment:

- frictional
- structural (unemployed people don't add value)
- cyclical (less demand for what they do)

In Keynes' terms, for demand policies to work it is important than unemployment be *unvoluntary*.

# New Classical


New classical economists wanted even more rigourous mathematical foundations.

No distinction between short term and long term.

Agent's behavours are specified by their ultimate goal (consumption, profit)

Agents are rational...

- utility/demand: $\max\limits_{\text{s.t.} p_1 C_1 + p_2 C_2 = B} U(C_1, C_2)$
- cost/supply: $\max_q π(q) = p q - w p$

...like in microeconomics. 

New classical economists established __microfoundations__ for modern macroeconomics.

---

# New Classical vs Keynesian ideas

The new classical program directly conflicted with some keynesian ideas.

For instance, the premise that agents are *rational* implies they should form *rational expectations*.

- use all available information to make informed forecasts
- as a result, they should not make systematic mistakes in predicting economic variables

In their traditional formulation, keynesian policies relied on agents paying less attention to their real income, agents started to realize it and changed their behaviour by asking for inflation-indexed wages.

---

# The Lucas critique

- This weakness of short term model formulated by Bob Lucas, as what becames the famous __Lucas critique__:
  - In 60s,  econometric models used by the central banks, were postulating some form of behaviour by agents, in particular a constant marginal propensity to consume, and a certain blindness of agents regarding inflation.
  -  But when these models led to actual policies, privates agents learnt how to adapt and changed their behaviour. 
- A good model should be *internally consistent*.
  - If agents of the model know what the model is (or which policy are taken), they should not change their behaviour.

---

# New classical: The nail in the keynesian coffin

- More generally, rational expectations were thought to invalidate the notion of involuntary unemployment and planned expenditures...
- ... but policy makers still needed some guidance for the short term and were reluctant to leave the short term keynesian model
- 1982: Kydland and Prescott: *real business cycles*
  - it is possible to explain short term fluctuations with only real variables
  - assuming some random changes in productivity
  - while maintaining the assumption of full rationality
- so, you see, no need for keynesian ideas ;)
- It became the dominant framework until the late 90s

Most macroeconomists now adhere to the rational expectations framework and most real world models feature elements from the new-keynesian framework.

This state of affairs is called the *the new classical synthesis* (or by some *the new keynesian synthesis*).

# Exective Summary

\framesubtitle{To remember}

- It took time for keynesian ideas to be developped and validated by economists...

. . . 

- ... but the need to smooth conjectural cycles through demand policies is recognized by virtually all macroeconomists nowawdays ...

. . . 

- ... who now have a common framework to develop and measure both keynesian and classical ideas.

# Learning guide

\framesubtitle{To understand}

- the economy in the long run
- the intuition for demand stimulus
- the keynesian cross (and how to compute the fiscal multiplier)
- why demand stimulus only works if there is unvoluntary unemployment
- what are the main features of the new keynesian synthesis:
  - microfoundations (rationality everywhere, especially on the demand side)
  - nominal rigidities for aggregate supply to react to prices
