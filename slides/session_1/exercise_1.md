## Exercise 1: Keynesian Cross

We consider an economy which produces $Y$.
The economy is populated with keynesian agents. They consume in total $C(y)= c_0 + c_1 y$ when their income is $y$ where $c_0$ and $c_1$ are positive constants (and $c_1<1$).
Total investment by firms is constant equal to $I=i_0$
Government spending amounts to $G=g_0$.

Total expenditures are given by the formula $C + I + G$.

1. Computing marginal propensity to consume of consumers
    - Assume consumers initially earn $Y$. What is their consumption $C(Y)$?
    - Now their consumption increases to $\Delta Y$. What is their new consumption $C(Y+\Delta Y)$ ?
    - What is their increase in consumption $\Delta C=C(Y+\Delta Y) - C(Y)$
    - What is their marginal propensity to consume?
2. Keynesian Cross (a.k.a. 45 degrees line)
    - Write down the equilibrium condition on the goods and services market.
    - Solve for $\overline{Y}$ such that this equilibrium condition is met.
    - Graphical representation
3. Fiscal Multiplier
    - Assume government spending go from $g_0$ to $g_0 + \Delta G$. $\Delta G$ is financed through debt which does not need to be repaid in the short run.
    - What is the new condition characterizing the equilibrium.
    - Write the new production as $Y + \Delta Y$ and compute $\Delta Y$
    - What is the fiscal multiplier?
    - Graphical representation.
    - Can you obtain the same result in a different way?
4. Spending and taxes.
    - Assume the government finances $\Delta G$ by raising an equivalent income tax on the consumers $\Delta T$. 
    - What is the new consumption of consumers?
    - What is the new equilibrium?
    - What is the new fiscal multiplier?
